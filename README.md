# OSDU-CI: Host-Mode Kubernetes Development Environment

A lightweight Kubernetes development setup using **Kind** directly on your host. Perfect for rapid development, testing, and CI/CD pipelines without heavy infrastructure.

## Overview

* **Single-node Kind cluster** optimized for development
* Works on **Mac, Linux, and Windows (WSL2)**
* Quick startup with simple deployment and hassle‑free cleanup

## Quick Start (Using Make)

```bash
make up        # Install dependencies + start cluster
make deploy    # Deploy default app (app1)
make status    # Check cluster health
```

**Common development commands:**

```bash
make restart   # Quick reset during development
make test      # Run validation tests
make clean     # Full cleanup
```

## Configuration

Edit `.env` to customize:

```bash
CLUSTER_NAME=osdu-ci
K8S_VERSION=v1.33.1
METALLB_ENABLED=true
INGRESS_ENABLED=true
FLUX_ENABLED=true
APP_DEPLOY=app1  # Options: app1 (basic), app2 (advanced)
```

---

## Usage Examples

Start and deploy:

```bash
make up
make deploy        # Deploy default app (app1)
make deploy app2   # Deploy advanced app with MetalLB/Ingress
make status
```

Reset cluster:

```bash
make restart
```

Stop or clean up:

```bash
make down    # Stop but preserve data
make clean   # Full cleanup
```

Manual debugging:

```bash
kubectl run debug --image=busybox --rm -it --restart=Never -- sh
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Common fixes:**

* Port conflicts → Check with `netstat -tulpn`
* Slow startup → Pre-pull node image: `docker pull kindest/node:v1.33.1`
* Memory issues → Increase Docker memory allocation

Diagnostics:

```bash
make status   # Cluster health
make logs     # Recent events
kubectl get pods -A
```
