# Cluster Health Report

Provide a comprehensive health assessment of the HostK8s cluster by analyzing both infrastructure and software deployment status.

Use both the `cluster-agent` and `software-agent` to gather insights, then present a clear summary of development readiness and any issues requiring attention.

Focus on actionable intelligence that helps developers understand their local environment status.
