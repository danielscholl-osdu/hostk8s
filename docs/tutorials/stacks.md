# Software Stacks

*Learn to compose existing HostK8s components into custom development environments*

| **Time** | **Level** | **Prerequisites** |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| ~60 minutes | 300 (Advanced) | Apps tutorial, Components tutorial, GitOps concepts |

## Overview

In the [Apps tutorial](apps.md), you learned to deploy individual applications. In the [Components tutorial](components.md), you learned to build shared infrastructure services like Redis that multiple applications can use.

**Software Stacks** are the final level - complete development environments that combine multiple components and applications into cohesive, production-like systems managed through GitOps automation.

Think of components like **Lego blocks** - each one does something useful (Redis, database, certificates), but by themselves they're just individual pieces. A **software stack** is like the instruction booklet that tells you which blocks to use and how to snap them together to build something amazing - a complete microservice platform.

In this tutorial, you'll create a custom **software stack** that demonstrates how the Redis component you built in the Components tutorial can be combined with applications and other infrastructure into a complete development environment.

**What You'll Build:**
- Custom software stack using existing HostK8s components
- Complete registry-based development workflow
- Custom application deployment through your stack

**Prerequisites:**
- **Completed [Apps tutorial](apps.md)** - Understanding of HostK8s applications
- **Completed [Components tutorial](components.md)** - Experience with shared infrastructure services
- **Basic GitOps concepts** - Understanding of declarative deployments
- **Familiarity with Flux** (covered in this tutorial)

### The Lego Block Concept

Just like Lego blocks, HostK8s has:

| Lego World | HostK8s World |
|------------|---------------|
| **Foundation blocks** | **Components** (Redis Infrastructure, cert-manager, databases) |
| **Feature blocks** | **Applications** (voting app, web services, APIs) |
| **Instruction booklet** | **Software Stack** (tells you which blocks to use and how to connect them) |
| **Finished model** | **Running development environment** |
| **Following instructions** | **GitOps/Flux** (automatically assembles everything) |

### Three Types of "Blocks"

```
Software Stack (The Instructions)
  ↙️        ↘️
Components     Applications
(Infrastructure/Middleware)  (Business Logic/Services)
```

**Components** - Infrastructure and middleware "blocks" you've learned to build:
- **From Components Tutorial**: Redis Infrastructure (Redis + Commander UI)
- **Built-in HostK8s**: cert-manager, Istio, metrics-server, databases
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Platform Services**: Airflow, observability, service mesh
- **Security**: Certificate management, RBAC systems

**Applications** - Business logic and service "blocks" (installed via Helm charts):
- **Microservices**: API services, web services, data processors
- **Service Groups**: Related microservices that form a complete platform layer
- **User-Facing Services**: Web UIs, mobile backends, customer APIs

**Software Stack** - The "instruction booklet" that defines:
- Which components and applications to deploy
- Dependency order (components typically before applications)
- How they connect and communicate
- Configuration and environment settings

### Why Stacks Matter

Without a stack, you have:
- Loose components that don't work together
- Manual setup every time
- Inconsistent environments
- Deployment chaos

With a stack, you get:
- Components that snap together perfectly
- One command deployment (`make up my-stack`)
- Consistent, reproducible environments
- GitOps automation

---

## Part 2: Your Lego Block Collection

Let's examine the existing HostK8s components (your "block collection") we'll use to build our tutorial stack.

### Available Components

**Platform Add-ons** (Kubernetes platform extensions):
- **flux-resources**: GitOps automation system - like the Lego building table that enables construction

**Components** (Infrastructure "blocks" installed via Helm):

| Component | Type | Purpose | Like a Lego... |
|-----------|------|---------|----------------|
| **metrics-server** | Platform Service | Cluster monitoring | Sensor block - tells you what's happening |
| **certs** | Security | Certificate management (cert-manager) | Safety block - keeps things secure |
| **certs-ca** | Security | Root certificate authority | Master key block |
| **certs-issuer** | Security | Certificate issuer | Key maker block |
| **registry** | Platform Service | Docker image storage | Storage block - holds your custom pieces |

**Complex Components** (from complex HostK8s stacks):
- **platform-system**: Istio service mesh, Redis cluster, PostgreSQL operator, Elastic operator
- **elastic-search**: Elasticsearch cluster for search and analytics
- **airflow**: Workflow orchestration and data pipeline management
- **observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger for monitoring and tracing

### Component Dependencies

Just like Lego instructions show "Step 1, then Step 2", components have dependencies:

```
Step 0: flux-resources (platform add-on - enables GitOps automation)
Step 1: metrics-server, certs (foundation components)
Step 2: certs-ca (builds on certs)
Step 3: certs-issuer (builds on certs-ca)
Step 4: registry (builds on certs-issuer)
```

**Why This Order Matters:**
- flux-resources is the platform add-on that enables GitOps - like having a proper building table
- certs must be installed before you can create certificates
- certs-ca must exist before certs-issuer can issue certificates
- registry needs certificates to run securely

### Understanding Stack Complexity

Complex stacks can have multiple layers with many interdependent components:

```
Complex Stack Example:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Applications (Business Logic)                               │
│ • Capability Group 1: service-1, service-2 (auth)         │
│ • Capability Group 2: service-3, service-4 (user mgmt)    │
│ • Capability Group 3: service-5, service-6 (data proc)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Components (Installed by Flux)                            │
│ • Security: cert-manager, certificate authorities         │
│ • Networking: Istio service mesh, ingress controllers     │
│ • Databases: PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch                    │
│ • Cache & Messaging: Redis cluster, message queues        │
│ • Platform Services: Airflow, observability, monitoring   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Foundation (Pre-installed)                                │
│ • Kubernetes: etcd, DNS, API server, scheduler            │
│ • Storage: Persistent volumes, storage classes            │
│ • Container Runtime: containerd, kubelet                  │
│ • Add-ons: Flux (kubectl apply), metrics-server (kubectl) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Our tutorial stack is intentionally simple, focusing on the registry development workflow.

### The Registry Component Deep Dive

Since our stack will include a registry for custom images, let's examine this "block":

The registry component includes:
- **Namespace**: Isolates the registry in its own space
- **PV/PVC**: Persistent storage (data survives restarts)
- **Deployment**: The actual Docker registry container
- **Service**: Network access (internal + external)

**What It Does:**
- Stores custom Docker images you build
- Provides HTTP API for push/pull operations
- Persists images in host storage (`data/registry/`)
- See Quick Reference section for endpoints and ports

---

## Part 3: Creating Your Tutorial Stack

### Step 1: Create Local Stack Files

First, create your tutorial stack locally as a HostK8s extension. This follows the standard HostK8s extension pattern and makes it easy to test and iterate.

**Create the extension directory:**
```bash
mkdir -p software/stack/extension/tutorial-stack
cd software/stack/extension/tutorial-stack
```

### Step 2: Define Your Stack

Every software stack needs three files in the extension directory:

#### kustomization.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  - repository.yaml
  - stack.yaml
```

#### repository.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: flux-system
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 5m
  url: https://community.opengroup.org/danielscholl/hostk8s
  ref:
    branch: main
  ignore: |
    # exclude all
    /*
    # include only shared components
    !/software/components/
```

#### stack.yaml (first part)
```yaml
######################
## Tutorial Stack
## Development stack for tutorial: includes registry, certs, and monitoring
######################
---
# Flux foundation - always required first
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: component-flux-resources
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 1h
  retryInterval: 1m
  timeout: 5m
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system
  path: ./software/components/flux-resources
  prune: true
  wait: true
  healthChecks:
    - kind: Deployment
      name: helm-controller
      namespace: flux-system
    - kind: Deployment
      name: kustomize-controller
      namespace: flux-system
    - kind: Deployment
      name: source-controller
      namespace: flux-system
```

*(The stack.yaml file continues with metrics-server, certs, certs-ca, certs-issuer, and registry - see the full file in your tutorial-stack directory)*

### Understanding the Files

Now that you've seen the complete structure, let's understand what each file does:

**kustomization.yaml** - Table of contents
- Tells Kustomize: "Read the repository configuration, then follow the stack assembly instructions"

**repository.yaml** - Where to find the HostK8s components
- **url**: Points to the main HostK8s repo to get the shared components
- **branch**: Which version to use (`main` for latest)
- **ignore**: Only sync the shared components directory (efficiency)
- **Note**: This references the HostK8s components, while your stack lives in your separate repo

**stack.yaml** - Assembly instructions
- Defines the dependency sequence (see Part 2 for details)
- **dependsOn**: "Don't start this block until these blocks are ready"
- **healthChecks**: "This block is ready when these specific things are running"
- **wait: true**: "Don't continue to next block until this one is healthy"

### Step 3: Initialize as Git Repository

Once you've created your stack files, initialize the extension as a Git repository to make it shareable and version-controlled:

```bash
# From the tutorial-stack directory
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial tutorial stack configuration"

# Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab named 'tutorial-stack'
# Then push your local repository:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/tutorial-stack.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Why This Step Matters:**
- Version control for your stack configuration
- Easy sharing with team members
- Backup of your custom stack design
- Foundation for collaborative development

### Understanding the Instructions

Each component definition is like a step in your Lego instructions:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: component-registry          # Step name
spec:
  dependsOn:                        # Wait for these steps first
    - name: component-certs-issuer
  path: ./software/components/registry  # Which block to use
  healthChecks:                     # How to know it's working
    - kind: Deployment
      name: registry
      namespace: registry
```

This tells Flux: "Deploy the registry component, but only after certs-issuer is ready, and don't consider it done until the registry deployment is healthy."

---

## Part 4: Custom Application Workflow

Now that we understand our stack, let's use it for a complete custom application workflow.

### The Development Scenario

You've built a custom web application and want to:
1. **Build** it into a Docker image
2. **Push** it to your private registry (in the stack)
3. **Deploy** it to run in your development environment

### Your Custom Application

HostK8s includes a sample application called `registry-demo` specifically for this workflow:

This is a simple web application that demonstrates the registry workflow. It's designed to show build metadata and registry integration.

### The Workflow Commands

Once your tutorial stack is running, the workflow is:

```bash
# 1. Deploy your tutorial stack (local extension)
make up extension/tutorial-stack

# 2. Build your custom application
make build src/registry-demo

# 3. Deploy your application (pulls from your registry)
make deploy registry-demo
```

Let's understand what each step does:

#### Step 1: Deploy Tutorial Stack
`make up extension/tutorial-stack` tells HostK8s:
- Use the local extension stack in `software/stack/extension/tutorial-stack/`
- Read the tutorial-stack instructions from your extension directory
- Deploy components in dependency order
- Wait for each component to be healthy
- Result: Complete development environment with private registry

#### Step 2: Build Custom Application
`make build src/registry-demo` tells HostK8s:
- Find the application source code
- Build it into a Docker image
- Tag it with your registry address
- Push it to your private registry
- Result: Custom image available for deployment

#### Step 3: Deploy Application
`make deploy registry-demo` tells HostK8s:
- Find the application deployment configuration
- Pull the image from your private registry
- Deploy it to your cluster
- Result: Custom application running and accessible

### Application Deployment Configuration

Your custom application also needs an "instruction" for how to deploy. The key part is:

```yaml
containers:
- name: registry-demo
  image: localhost:5443/registry-demo:latest  # Pulls from your private registry
```

This tells Kubernetes: "Pull this container image from localhost:5443 (your private registry) instead of Docker Hub."

---

## Part 5: Testing Your Stack

Let's deploy and test your custom tutorial stack.

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy your custom tutorial stack (local extension)
make up extension/tutorial-stack
```

**What happens:**
1. HostK8s reads your stack "instructions"
2. Flux deploys components in dependency order
3. Each component waits for its dependencies to be healthy
4. Result: Complete development environment with registry

### Monitor Progress

```bash
# Watch the deployment happen
make status
```

You'll see components deploy in order:
- flux-resources (first)
- metrics-server, certs (parallel)
- certs-ca (after certs)
- certs-issuer (after certs-ca)
- registry (after certs-issuer)

---

## Part 6: Testing Your Stack

Now let's test the complete development workflow your tutorial stack enables.

### Test Registry Access

First, verify your private registry is working:

```bash
# Test registry API (may need port-forward if NodePort not accessible)
kubectl port-forward -n registry service/registry 5000:5000 &
curl http://localhost:5000/v2/

# Should return: {}
```

### Build Custom Application

The tutorial stack enables the full build → push → deploy workflow:

```bash
# Build your custom application and push to private registry
make build src/registry-demo
```

**What happens:**
- HostK8s finds the `src/registry-demo` application source
- Builds Docker image from the source code
- Tags image for your private registry (`localhost:5045/registry-demo:latest`)
- Pushes to your tutorial stack's registry
- Image is now available for deployment

### Deploy Custom Application

```bash
# Deploy the application (pulls from your private registry)
make deploy registry-demo

# Check deployment status
kubectl get pods -l app=registry-demo
```

**What happens:**
- HostK8s reads the `registry-demo` deployment configuration
- Kubernetes pulls the image from your private registry
- Application starts using your custom-built image
- Result: Your code running in your development environment

### Access Your Application

```bash
# Check if application is accessible
kubectl port-forward service/registry-demo 8080:80 &
curl http://localhost:8080

# Or check pod logs
kubectl logs -l app=registry-demo
```

### Validation Checklist

Your tutorial stack is working when:

- **Registry API responds**: `curl http://localhost:30500/v2/` returns `{}`
- **Custom image builds**: `make build src/registry-demo` succeeds
- **Image in registry**: `curl http://localhost:30500/v2/_catalog` shows `{"repositories":["registry-demo"]}`
- **App deploys**: `kubectl get pods -l app=registry-demo` shows running pods
- **App accessible**: `curl http://localhost:30510` returns HTML

### Troubleshooting

**Component stuck deploying?**
```bash
kubectl describe kustomization component-name -n flux-system
```

**Registry not accessible?**
```bash
kubectl get pods -n registry
kubectl logs -n registry deployment/registry
```

**Application won't start?**
```bash
kubectl describe pods -l app=registry-demo
kubectl logs -l app=registry-demo
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Mixed Installation Patterns

While this tutorial focuses on GitOps-managed stacks, HostK8s stacks also serve as excellent foundations for manually installed applications:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Manual Applications (helm/kubectl)     │  ← Added manually
│ • dev-tools, monitoring dashboards     │
│ • experimental apps, personal tools    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stack Applications (GitOps-managed)    │  ← From stack.yaml
│ • Capability groups and microservices  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stack Components (GitOps-managed)      │  ← Shared foundation
│ • Databases, networking, monitoring    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Deploy your stack foundation (local extension)
make up extension/tutorial-stack

# Stack provides PostgreSQL, Redis, service mesh, monitoring...

# Then manually add development tools
helm install pgadmin postgresql/pgadmin4
kubectl apply -f my-debug-pod.yaml
```

This approach leverages stack-provided infrastructure while maintaining development flexibility. The manually installed applications can use the databases, networking, and monitoring that your stack provides.
