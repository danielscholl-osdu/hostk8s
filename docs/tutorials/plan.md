```

### **Skill Building Progression**
```
Deploy â†’ Optimize â†’ Orchestrate â†’ Develop â†’ Deploy to Cloud
  â†“         â†“          â†“           â†“            â†“
K8s      Component   GitOps     IDE/Debug    Cloud/Prod
Basics   Architecture Automation  Workflows   Infrastructure
```

## Source Code Strategy

### **Reference Implementation**
- **Location**: `src/example-voting-app/` (existing reference)
- **Purpose**: Source of truth for original Docker voting app
- **Usage**: Reference for creating development-optimized versions

### **Development Codebase Structure**
```
src/voting-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Development setup guide
â”œâ”€â”€ vote/                        # Python Flask service (Level 400 focus)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile.dev          # Development with hot-reload
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile.prod         # Production-ready image
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                  # Main Flask application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.dev.yml # Local development setup
â”œâ”€â”€ worker/                     # .NET service (reference)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...                    # Simplified for scope
â””â”€â”€ result/                     # Node.js service (reference)

## Risk Assessment

### **High Risk**
- **Development workflow complexity**: IDE debugging across container boundaries
- **Cloud deployment costs**: DigitalOcean resource management
- **Tutorial length**: Maintaining engagement through longer tutorials

### **Medium Risk**
- **Platform compatibility**: VS Code integration across different operating systems
- **Source code maintenance**: Keeping voting app code current
- **User skill assumptions**: Balancing beginner vs intermediate content

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Start with simplest development patterns (Python Flask)
- Provide clear cost estimates and cleanup procedures
- Create modular tutorials that can be consumed independently
- Comprehensive testing across platforms and skill levels

## Notes and Considerations

### **Why DigitalOcean?**
- **Cost-effective**: Affordable for tutorial purposes
- **Beginner-friendly**: Excellent documentation and user experience
- **Kubernetes service**: Managed control plane reduces complexity
- **Community**: Strong developer community and resources

### **Development Focus Rationale**
- **Python Flask**: Most accessible language for development tutorial
- **Single service focus**: Reduces complexity while teaching key concepts
- **Real infrastructure**: Debugging connected to actual Redis and database
- **Practical skills**: IDE integration that developers use daily

### **Future Enhancements**
- Multi-language development workflows (Node.js, .NET)
- Advanced debugging patterns and tools
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Multi-cloud deployment strategies
- Team collaboration and GitOps workflows
