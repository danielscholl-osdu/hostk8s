# Deploying Applications

*Understanding HostK8s application patterns and why they eliminate deployment complexity*

## The Application Deployment Problem

You've configured your cluster architecture and experienced how HostK8s eliminates the complexity of managing Kubernetes infrastructure. But infrastructure is just the foundation - the real challenge is **what you deploy on it**.

Traditional Kubernetes application deployment creates the same complexity problems that HostK8s solves at the infrastructure level:

- **Deployment chaos** - Dozens of YAML files to track, apply in the right order, and manage individually
- **Environment inconsistency** - Hard-coded values that work locally but break in different environments
- **Team conflicts** - Developers stepping on each other's ports and configurations
- **Resource waste** - Every application deploying its own copy of identical infrastructure services

HostK8s solves application deployment complexity through **application patterns** that provide the same benefits as the host-mode architecture: consistent interfaces, declarative configuration, and complexity abstraction that lets you focus on functionality rather than mechanics.

---

## Understanding HostK8s Applications

Let's start by getting our cluster running and deploying an application to understand what makes it work:

```bash
# Start your cluster with ingress capabilities
export INGRESS_ENABLED=true
make start
make deploy simple
make status
```

Now let's understand what made this work by examining the anatomy of a HostK8s application:

Explore the individual files of the [simple](../../software/apps/simple/) you'll see the anatomy of a HostK8s application:
```
README.md
configmap.yaml      # Application configuration and content
deployment.yaml     # Pod specification and runtime behavior
ingress.yaml       # External access and routing rules
kustomization.yaml # HostK8s application contract
service.yaml       # Internal networking and discovery
```

The critical file is `kustomization.yaml` - this creates the contract between your application and the HostK8s platform:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

metadata:
  name: simple
  labels:
    hostk8s.app: simple

resources:
  - configmap.yaml
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
  - ingress.yaml

labels:
  - pairs:
      hostk8s.app: simple
```

**This contract tells HostK8s:**
- **Identity**: "This application is called `simple`"
- **Composition**: "These files define everything needed to run it"
- **Labeling**: "Apply `hostk8s.app: simple` to every resource automatically"
- **Management**: "Enable unified operations on all resources belonging to this app"

**The labeling mechanism is key to how HostK8s works.** Notice there are two places where `hostk8s.app: simple` appears:

1. **`metadata.labels`**: Labels the Kustomization itself
2. **`labels.pairs`**: Automatically applies this label to *all* resources (deployments, services, ingresses, etc.)

This automatic labeling is what enables `make status` to find and display all resources belonging to the "simple" application as a unified group. When you run `make status`, HostK8s queries Kubernetes for all resources with `hostk8s.app: simple` and presents them together - regardless of whether they're deployments, services, or ingresses.

### Why This Contract Matters

Compare what you experienced vs. the manual alternative:

**HostK8s application deployment:**
```bash
make deploy simple    # One command, consistent interface
make status          # Clean unified view of what's running
make remove simple   # Complete cleanup with dependency tracking
```

**Manual Kubernetes approach:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f software/apps/simple/configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f software/apps/simple/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f software/apps/simple/service.yaml
kubectl apply -f software/apps/simple/ingress.yaml
# Remember what you deployed
kubectl get deployments,services,ingresses -l hostk8s.app=simple
# Clean up each piece individually
kubectl delete -f software/apps/simple/configmap.yaml
kubectl delete -f software/apps/simple/deployment.yaml
# ... repeat for each file
```

**The HostK8s advantage:** The application contract abstracts Kubernetes complexity. You think about deploying "simple" - the platform handles the **orchestration mechanics**, **dependency ordering**, and **resource management**.

---

## Multi-Service Applications

Single-service applications like `simple` demonstrate the contract, but most real applications require multiple cooperating services. Let's experience this complexity progression.

### Service-to-Service Communication

Deploy the basic application to see multi-service architecture:

```bash
make deploy basic
make status
```

You'll see a more complex deployment:
```
📱 basic
   Deployment: api (1/1 ready)
   Deployment: frontend (1/1 ready)
   Service: api (ClusterIP, internal only)
   Service: frontend (NodePort 30082)
   Ingress: basic -> http://localhost:8080/basic
```

Visit http://localhost:8080/basic and interact with the application.

**What you're experiencing:** The frontend service calls the API service internally using Kubernetes service discovery (`api.default.svc.cluster.local`), while only the frontend is exposed externally. This demonstrates the **internal vs external service pattern** that's fundamental to microservice architectures.

### The Configuration Inflexibility Problem

Let's experience the limitation that drives teams toward more sophisticated solutions. Try deploying multiple applications:

```bash
# Clean up first to avoid conflicts
make remove simple
# Now deploy both apps
make deploy basic
make deploy simple
```

You might get a conflict error like:
```
Service "sample-app" invalid: spec.ports[0].nodePort: Invalid value: 30081: provided port is already allocated
```

**The problem:** Both applications have hard-coded port assignments in their YAML files. The simple app uses NodePort 30081, and basic app tries to use conflicting ports.

### The Feature Branch Comparison Problem

Imagine you're working on changes to the basic app's API. You want to compare your feature branch behavior against the main branch to make sure your changes work correctly. Traditionally, you'd have to stop one version to test the other, making comparison difficult.

With HostK8s, you can run both simultaneously. Clean up first:

```bash
make remove basic
make remove simple  # if it deployed
```

Now deploy what would represent both versions of your app:

```bash
make deploy basic main-branch
make deploy basic feature-api-changes
make status
```

You'll see both versions running side-by-side:
```
📱 main-branch.basic
   Deployment: api (1/1 ready)
   Deployment: frontend (1/1 ready)
   ...
📱 feature-api-changes.basic
   Deployment: api (1/1 ready)
   Deployment: frontend (1/1 ready)
   ...
```

**Try accessing both versions:**
- Visit http://localhost:8080/basic - which version are you seeing?
- The second deployment likely overwrote the first one's ingress

**The ingress conflict problem:** Both deployments try to create ingress resources with the same path (`/basic`). The ingress controller can't route the same path to different services - you can only access one version, defeating the purpose of side-by-side comparison.

Look at the hardcoded values in the basic app:
```yaml
# software/apps/basic/ingress.yaml - STATIC VALUES
spec:
  rules:
  - host: localhost
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /basic  # ← Same for every deployment!
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: frontend  # ← Same service name!
```

**The core limitation:** Static YAML files can't change values at deployment time. There's no way to make the ingress path `/main-branch/basic` for one deployment and `/feature-api-changes/basic` for another. Every deployment gets identical, conflicting values.

---

## Template-Based Flexibility

You just experienced the fundamental limitation of static YAML files: **you can't change values at deployment time**. This is exactly why Helm templates exist - to make values dynamic based on how you deploy.

Let's see how HostK8s solves this while maintaining the same intuitive `make deploy` interface. Clean up first:

```bash
make remove basic main-branch
make remove basic feature-api-changes
```

### The Voting Application: Production-Ready Complexity

Deploy the voting application, which uses Helm templating:

```bash
make deploy advanced
make status
```

You'll see a sophisticated multi-service system:
```
📱 advanced (Helm Chart: helm-sample-0.1.0, Release: advanced)
   Deployment: db (1/1 ready)
   Deployment: redis (1/1 ready)
   Deployment: result (1/1 ready)
   Deployment: vote (1/1 ready)
   Deployment: worker (1/1 ready)
   Service: db (ClusterIP, internal only)
   Service: redis (ClusterIP, internal only)
   Service: result (ClusterIP, internal only)
   Service: vote (ClusterIP, internal only)
   Ingress: advanced-helm-sample -> http://localhost:8080/vote
```

Visit http://localhost:8080/vote to interact with the complete voting system.

**Notice the ingress path:** Unlike the basic app, this shows `http://localhost:8080/vote` - but what happens when we deploy multiple versions?

### How Helm Solves the Deployment Conflict

Now let's deploy multiple versions of the voting app to see how Helm templates solve the problem we just experienced:

```bash
# Deploy your feature branch version
make deploy advanced feature-new-architecture

# Deploy main branch for comparison
make deploy advanced main-stable

make status
```

You'll see multiple isolated instances:
```
📱 advanced.helm-sample (Helm Chart: ...)
📱 feature-new-architecture.helm-sample (Helm Chart: ...)
📱 main-stable.helm-sample (Helm Chart: ...)
```

**No conflicts!** Now try accessing both versions:
- http://localhost:8080/vote → original version
- http://localhost:8080/feature-new-architecture/vote → your feature branch
- http://localhost:8080/main-stable/vote → stable main branch

**Each deployment gets unique ingress paths automatically!** This is what Helm templates enable - the same YAML structure generates different concrete values based on deployment names.

### Multi-Version Development Workflow

Now imagine you're working on a major feature that changes the voting app architecture. You want to run your feature branch alongside the stable main branch, but your feature needs different configurations - more memory for debugging, different environment variables, maybe even different replica counts for testing scalability.

```bash
# Deploy your feature branch with development-specific configuration
make deploy advanced feature-new-architecture dev

# Deploy main branch with standard settings for comparison
make deploy advanced main-stable staging

make status
```

You'll see both versions with their own configurations:
```
📱 feature-new-architecture.helm-sample (Helm Chart: ..., Release: feature-new-architecture)
📱 main-stable.helm-sample (Helm Chart: ..., Release: main-stable)
📱 dev.helm-sample (Helm Chart: ...)
📱 staging.helm-sample (Helm Chart: ...)
```

### Understanding Template-Driven Configuration

Let's examine what makes this flexibility possible:

```bash
ls software/apps/advanced/
```

You'll see the Helm chart architecture:
```
Chart.yaml              # Chart metadata and versioning
values.yaml            # Default configuration values
values/
  development.yaml     # Development environment overrides
  production.yaml      # Production environment overrides
templates/             # Template files with variable substitution
  vote-deployment.yaml # Templated Kubernetes resources
  db-service.yaml
  ...
```

**Templates replace hard-coded values with variables:**

Looking at [vote-deployment.yaml](../../software/apps/advanced/templates/vote-deployment.yaml), you'll see templated configuration like:
```yaml
replicas: {{ .Values.vote.replicas }}
image: "{{ .Values.vote.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.vote.image.tag }}"
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "{{ .Values.vote.resources.requests.memory }}"
    cpu: "{{ .Values.vote.resources.requests.cpu }}"
ports:
- containerPort: {{ .Values.vote.service.port }}
```

**Values files provide environment-specific configurations:**

Compare [values.yaml](../../software/apps/advanced/values.yaml) with [development.yaml](../../software/apps/advanced/values/development.yaml) - you'll see development environments get more resources for debugging tools and verbose logging.

### The Interface Consistency Advantage

Notice the key insight - **HostK8s maintains the same interface regardless of underlying complexity:**

**Simple static app:**
```bash
make deploy simple
```

**Multi-service app:**
```bash
make deploy basic alice
```

**Complex templated app with environment-specific configuration:**
```bash
make deploy advanced dev
make deploy advanced staging
NAMESPACE=bob-testing make deploy advanced
```

**The HostK8s abstraction:** Whether your application uses static YAML or sophisticated Helm templating with environment-specific values, you use the same `make deploy` interface. The complexity is hidden when you don't need it, but available when you do.

---

## The Resource Duplication Discovery

You now have multiple instances of complex applications running. Let's examine what this means for resource utilization:

```bash
# Count infrastructure services across all deployments
kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces | grep -E "(redis|db)"
```

**What you'll discover:** Redundant infrastructure across deployments:
- 4+ Redis instances (one per voting app deployment)
- 4+ PostgreSQL databases (one per voting app deployment)

### The Resource Mathematics

Check actual resource consumption:

```bash
# Examine resource usage of infrastructure services
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces | grep -E "(redis|db)"
```

**Per voting app deployment, you're running:**
- Redis: ~64MB memory, ~25m CPU
- PostgreSQL: ~128MB memory, ~100m CPU

**With 4 voting app instances (advanced, dev, staging, alice):**
- 4 Redis instances = ~256MB memory, ~100m CPU
- 4 PostgreSQL databases = ~512MB memory, ~400m CPU
- **Total infrastructure overhead: ~768MB memory just for duplication**

### The Management Complexity Challenge

Beyond the resource consumption, there's also the operational overhead to consider. Each Redis and database instance needs its own updates, monitoring, and security configuration. With 4+ of each, you're managing 8+ services—each requiring individual attention for updates, backups, and troubleshooting. Issues could originate in any of these services, and you need separate backup strategies for each database instance.

While Helm solved configuration flexibility and team collaboration, it also introduced **infrastructure duplication**. In a real development environment with multiple applications and teams, this becomes unsustainable - hundreds of MB of duplicated services consuming resources and creating management complexity.

## The Complete Source-to-Deployment Workflow

HostK8s provides a complete development workflow from source code to running applications. Let's experience this end-to-end process.

### Building Applications from Source

The applications you've deployed use pre-built container images, but HostK8s supports building from source code. Check what's available:

```bash
ls src/
```

You'll see source code directories. Let's use `registry-demo` - a simple application designed to demonstrate the build workflow:

```bash
ls src/registry-demo/
cat src/registry-demo/README.md
```

### The Build Process

Build this source code into a container image:

```bash
make build src/registry-demo
```

**What happens:**
- HostK8s locates the source code and Dockerfile
- Builds the application into a container image using Docker
- Tags it appropriately for your cluster's container registry
- Pushes it to the registry where Kubernetes can access it

### Deploying Your Built Application

Now deploy the application you built:

```bash
make deploy registry-demo
make status
```

Visit the application (check status output for URL) and see your code running in Kubernetes.

**The complete workflow you experienced:**

1. **Source code** in `src/registry-demo/`
2. **Build process** → `make build src/registry-demo` → container image in registry
3. **Deployment** → `make deploy registry-demo` → running application in Kubernetes
4. **Your code** executing in a production-like environment

**Future tutorial note:** The voting application currently uses pre-built images, but in advanced tutorials you'll rebuild it from source using `make build src/voting-app/`, demonstrating how to iterate on complex multi-service applications during development.

## Application Architecture Evolution

### Understanding the Progression

You've experienced the natural evolution that drives application architecture decisions:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Static YAML     │───▶│ Multi-Service YAML  │───▶│ Helm Templates       │
│ Single Service  │    │ Frontend + API      │    │ Multi-env Flexible   │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────────┘    └──────────────────────┘
         ▼                        ▼                          ▼
   Port Conflicts          Team Collaboration        Infrastructure
                          Inflexibility             Duplication
```

**Simple Applications (Static YAML):**
- ✅ Perfect for single-service applications and demos
- ✅ Easy to understand and deploy
- ❌ Port conflicts prevent multiple simultaneous deployments
- ❌ Configuration inflexibility across environments

**Multi-Service Applications (Enhanced Static YAML):**
- ✅ Service-to-service communication and architectural patterns
- ✅ Internal vs external service separation
- ❌ Still suffer from port conflicts and configuration rigidity
- ❌ Team collaboration friction from identical configurations

**Production Applications (Helm Templates):**
- ✅ Environment-specific configuration through templating
- ✅ Complete team isolation and customizable deployments
- ✅ Production-ready multi-service architecture patterns
- ❌ **Infrastructure duplication and resource waste**
- ❌ **Management complexity from multiple identical services**

### The Design Pattern Recognition

What you've experienced demonstrates two fundamental design patterns that make HostK8s different from raw Kubernetes development.

The **Application Contract Pattern** creates consistency across all complexity levels. Whether you're deploying a simple static app or a sophisticated Helm chart, you always work with the same `kustomization.yaml` interface and the same `make deploy/remove/status` commands. The platform handles Kubernetes complexity transparently while you focus on application logic.

The **Complexity Abstraction Pattern** means the same interface works regardless of underlying sophistication. Environmental and team configuration happens transparently, the build workflow integrates seamlessly with deployment, and progressive complexity doesn't require learning new interfaces. This is why `make deploy` works identically for static YAML and complex Helm charts.

### Choosing the Right Pattern

Your choice between static YAML and Helm templates depends on configuration needs, not application complexity. Use static YAML when building single-service applications, creating proof-of-concepts, or when configuration doesn't need to vary across environments. Static approaches prioritize simplicity and immediate understanding.

Move to Helm charts when you need to deploy to multiple environments, when team collaboration requires different configurations per developer, or when complex multi-service applications have many configurable aspects. Use templates when the need for configuration flexibility outweighs the overhead of added complexity.

### The Infrastructure Sharing Problem

You've discovered the fundamental challenge in application deployment: **configuration flexibility creates infrastructure duplication**. Every deployment gets its own Redis, database, and supporting services, leading to:

- **Resource waste** - Hundreds of MB consumed by duplicate infrastructure
- **Management overhead** - Multiple identical services requiring individual attention
- **Debugging complexity** - Issues spread across numerous duplicate components
- **Scaling inefficiency** - Resources consumed by duplication rather than functionality

**The next architectural challenge:** How do you maintain application flexibility and team isolation while sharing infrastructure services efficiently?

---

## The Source Code Development Future

The applications you've deployed represent different stages of the development workflow:

**Current State (This Tutorial):**
- Applications use **pre-built container images** from registries
- Focus on deployment patterns, configuration, and Kubernetes integration
- Voting app demonstrates production-ready multi-service architecture

**Future Development Workflow:**
- **Rebuild applications from source** using `make build src/voting-app/`
- **Iterate on code** while running in Kubernetes environment
- **Debug services** connected to real infrastructure (Redis, databases)
- **Hot-reload development** for rapid iteration cycles

The voting application will continue as your consistent learning thread, evolving from pre-built deployment to active development environment while maintaining the same HostK8s interface patterns you've learned.

---

## Cleanup and Summary

Clean up your test deployments:

```bash
make remove advanced feature-new-architecture
make remove advanced main-stable
make remove advanced staging
make remove advanced dev
make remove advanced
make remove registry-demo
```
