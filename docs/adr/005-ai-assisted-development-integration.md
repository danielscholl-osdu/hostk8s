# ADR-005: AI-Assisted Development Integration

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-07-30

## Context
Modern development platforms benefit from AI assistance to accelerate complex operations, reduce cognitive load, and improve developer productivity. HostK8s, being a GitOps-focused Kubernetes development platform, involves intricate operations across cluster management, GitOps workflows, and debugging scenarios that are ideal candidates for AI enhancement. However, AI assistance must remain optional to preserve the platform's core accessibility and not create dependencies for users who prefer traditional workflows.

## Decision
Integrate **optional AI-assisted development capabilities** through a three-layer architecture: MCP servers for cross-tool compatibility, specialized sub-agents for domain-specific tasks, and automated hooks for quality assurance. This integration enhances productivity for users who choose to enable it while maintaining full platform functionality for traditional development workflows.

## Rationale
1. **Productivity Multiplier**: AI assistance reduces time for complex GitOps debugging and cluster analysis
2. **Optional Enhancement**: Zero impact on users who prefer traditional workflows
3. **Extensible Architecture**: MCP protocol enables future multi-tool compatibility
4. **Domain Specialization**: Targeted AI agents for specific HostK8s workflows
5. **Quality Automation**: Automated enforcement of project standards without manual oversight
6. **Learning Acceleration**: Natural language queries reduce learning curve for complex Kubernetes operations

### Layer 1: MCP Server Integration
- **kubernetes**: Core Kubernetes operations (pods, services, deployments, logs, events)
- **flux-operator-mcp**: GitOps operations (Flux resources, documentation, dependency analysis)
- **Cross-Tool Protocol**: Standard MCP interface designed for multiple AI assistants
- **Multi-Agent Support**: All MCP-compatible AI agents can access these servers

### Layer 2: Specialized Sub-Agents (Claude Code Exclusive)
- **cluster-agent**: Infrastructure analysis specialist (cluster health, pod troubleshooting, node problems)
- **software-agent**: GitOps and Flux specialist (deployment failures, Kustomization problems, HelmRelease troubleshooting)
- **gitops-committer**: Git workflow specialist (clean history, branch management, pre-commit automation)
- **Availability**: Currently exclusive to Claude Code due to specialized sub-agent architecture
- **Future Expansion**: Other AI agents may gain sub-agent support as their architectures evolve

### Layer 3: Automated Hooks (Claude Code Exclusive)
- **Quality Enhancement**: Automatic commit message improvement and branch naming enforcement
- **GitOps Integration**: Automatic Flux reconciliation when GitOps files change
- **Development Acceleration**: Pre-commit checks and standards enforcement
- **Graceful Degradation**: Platform functions normally when hooks disabled
- **Availability**: Currently exclusive to Claude Code hook system

### Cross-Agent Features
- **Custom Command Prompts**: Available in Claude Code and GitHub Copilot
- **MCP Server Access**: Universal protocol supporting all compatible AI agents

## Multi-Agent Support Strategy

### Tiered Capability Approach
**Primary Support (Claude Code)**:
- Full MCP server access for Kubernetes operations
- Exclusive access to specialized sub-agents (cluster-agent, software-agent, gitops-committer)
- Automated hooks for quality assurance and GitOps integration
- Custom command prompts for workflow automation
- Priority for new feature development

**Secondary Support (GitHub Copilot)**:
- MCP server access for basic Kubernetes operations
- Custom command prompts for common workflows
- No sub-agent or hook support (architectural limitation)

**Future Support (OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Warp Terminal)**:
- MCP server compatibility as protocols mature
- Custom command prompt support as capabilities develop
- Sub-agent and hook support dependent on AI agent architecture evolution

### Feature Availability Matrix

- **Decision**: Rejected in favor of extensible MCP architecture

### 3. Manual AI Integration Only
- **Pros**: User-controlled AI interaction, no automation
- **Cons**: Misses opportunities for quality automation, higher cognitive load
- **Decision**: Rejected in favor of hybrid manual/automated approach

### 4. ChatOps-Style Integration
- **Pros**: Familiar chat interface, team collaboration
